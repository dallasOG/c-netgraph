Graph-network manager in C
===========================

A small command-line utility written in C that simulates
a computer network of up to eight machines. It lets you 
create/remove weighted links, inspect the adjacency matrix, 
and trace connectivity with Depth-First Search (DFS) through 
an interactive text menu.
